# Developing Conversational Pattern Mining using Large Language Models

Welcome to **CUSTOM-GPT**, a domain-specific assistant designed to evaluate and enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of **Pattern Mining**.

This project benchmarks LLMs (like GPT-4, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) on a set of theoretical and implementation-focused queries — across **zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting paradigms** — with and without the **PAMI Library**.

---

##  Project Description

This repository supports a thesis project that investigates:

- How general-purpose LLMs perform in **technical domains** like Pattern Mining.
- The benefit of **custom-tuned assistants** trained on domain-specific documentation and examples.
- How **prompt engineering** (zero/one/few-shot) impacts model accuracy.
- A comparison of LLM outputs **with and without** access to the **PAMI Python Library**.

---

##  What's Included

-  30 Evaluation Queries  
  - Covers **theory**, **code-based implementation**, and **dataset generation**
-  Model Responses from:
  - GPT-4, Copilot, Gemini, DeepSeek, Perplexity
-  PAMI-GPT: A custom GPT trained using PAMI documentation and instruction-tuned examples
-  Rubric-based Evaluation (5-point scoring system)
-  Visual Comparisons (coming soon)

---

## Prompting Styles Used

| Prompt Type | Description                             |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Zero-shot   | Direct questions without examples       |
| One-shot    | One example shown before the query      |
| Few-shot    | Multiple examples shown before the query|

---

## Key Technologies

- Python (for code execution & testing)
- OpenAI Custom GPT / ChatGPT
- Pattern Mining (PAMI Framework – domain reference only)
- Manual and rubric-based LLM evaluation

---

##  Upload Soon

-  Evaluation graphs (accuracy comparisons, error types)
-  Knowledge Files
-  Instruction
-  Research paper and thesis PDF
-  Demo notebooks or web UI (optional)
